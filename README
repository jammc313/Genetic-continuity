This repository contains a collection of notebooks and scripts used in a project investigating genetic continuity among temporally distributed genomes.
Included in Simulations/ are notebooks for running msprime simulations for various demographic models and to calculate anchor statistics and f-statistics on the resulting dataset.
Included in Anchor_test/ is a pipeline for running the Anchor method; a novel test for genetic continuity, with empirical datasets.
